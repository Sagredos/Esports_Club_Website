## Project Description
This project was for the California State University Sacramento Esports Club. This project was to help the club have more outreach and allow for the club to have a more professional look.

## Background
The Esports Club of California State University Sacramento is an "Electronic Sports" club that hosts both casual and competitive video game events. The club is meant for bringing together students that are just interested in video games as well those who want to compete in gaming leagues and tournaments. Our client is Isaac Rodriguez, the current president, and Sean Tirado, the future president, of the California State University Sacramento Esports Club. The problem that was proposed by them was to create a site for expanding the esports club and add a look of professionalism to the club.

<p>Sprint 00 consisted of getting a client for our senior project. In this process, the team Stingers found that the recently added Sacramento State Esports Club did not have a website. The Stingers brought the proposal to Julia Barges, the President of the club during the Fall 2021 semester who accepted the teams proposal. In this proposal, the team Stingers were to develop a webpage for the club in hope to increase student involvment. </p>

<p id="Sprint01" align="center">Sprint 01 </p>
<p>Sprint 01 focused on the planning of the project. Team the Stingers, developed a context diagram and Business event table for the project. This helped dramatically with the development of the project.</p>

<p id="Sprint02" align="center" >Sprint 02 </p>
<p>During Sprint 02, the team's goal was to develop a prototype. This process began with a very rough paper sketch (picture below). <img src="https://github.com/MARTYC0DES/seniorProject/blob/main/images/roughPrototype.PNG" width="60%" height="60%"> <br> The team then used Figma to develop a proper protoype and the look of the user interface for the webpage.

<p id="Sprint03" align="center">Sprint 03 </p>
<p>Sprint 03 was the development of Tech Stack for our project. The team Stingers decided to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP for various reasons. Hypertext markup language because it is the structure for a webpage and it's content. It is the foundation of a website which contains the information which tells the browser what is on the page. We used CSS, because it made the front-end of the website look appealing while also creating a great user experience. Without CSS, the website would have looked unappealing and would have made it impossible for users to navigate through the website. Javascript, to handle the user inputs and validation. It also allowed us to make the web application interactive. It is also one of the most commonly used programming languages by developers so the team wanted to gain experience in this language.
</p>

<p id="Sprint04" align="center">Sprint 04 </p>
<p>Sprint 04 was centered around the team setting up their work environment. For our integrated development environment, the team decided to use Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web applications, and it is also free. With this in mind, the team felt Visual Studio Code was perfect for our project. For code source management we used GitHub, which offers storing, tracking, and collaborating on a software project. Lastly, for tracking product development we used Jira. Jira is perfect for project management. </p>

<p id="Sprint05" align="center">Sprint 05 </p>
<p>Sprint 05 was the development of a working User Interface. The team began this sprint by creating the landing page for the clubâ€™s website. During the development of the User Interface, the team made sure to build the site exactly the way it looked in the prototype. </p>

<p id="Sprint06" align="center">Sprint 06 </p>
<p>Sprint 06 was the contiued deveopment of the User Interface. The team began development of the watch page, match page, teams page, about page, and contact page. The team also continued developing the landing page. The team developed the pages according to the protypes. The watch page helps outreach by showing the club's twitch stream and some highlights. The teams page contains information about each team and their players. The about page includes information on the club itself. The match page shows when club events happen, and includes a link if streamed. The contact page shows how to contact the club management.  
</p>

<p id="Sprint07" align="center">Sprint 07 </p>
<p>In Sprint 07 the team continued developing the User interface according to the protypes and the client's standards. Part of the team began development of the database. During this Sprint the team Stingers met with the clients to discuss possible finishing touches. The clients displayed mostly postive feedback, but expressed some final wants that the team was able to accomadate during the next Sprint.
</p>

<p id="Sprint08" align="center">Sprint 08 </p>
<p>During Sprint 08 the team was finishing the last touches and began deploying the product. The team also deployed functionality in order to ensure the website worked on computers as well as mobile devices. Towards the end of the sprint the team began Testing.
</p>

<p id="Sprint09" align="center">Sprint 09 </p>
<p>In Sprint 09 the team was wrapping up development and finishing system testing.
In testing the team made sure that everything worked as expected, and that there were not any bugs within the website.</p>

<p id="Sprint10" align="center">Sprint 10 </p>
<p>In Sprint 10 our website is deployed and we are finalzing documentation in order to hand over the project.

## Prototype
Our Prototype begin its development with a rough paper sketch of a wireframe. The purpose of the wireframe was to maximize the site's user experience potential before it is actually avaliable to visitors. By creating the wireframe, this allowed us to troubleshoot issues before they became a problem to our users also allowing the development team to save time. 

After the wireframe was completed, the team began developing a mock-up of the site. The development team used both Figma and photoshop as our prototype tool. While creating the User Interface of the webpage, the development had to keep in mind the color combinations allowed. Being that the website would be a Sacramento State University club, there were many guildline to follow. When the mockup was complete, the team ended up with the following (image below).

<h2 id="prototype"> Installation </h2>
To open in edit these files you fitst must download a development environment, or IDE. We uised VIsual Studion code to make all of our edits when creating the files.
The link to downloading the IDE can be found here: [Visual Sudio Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com "Visual Sudio Code Download"). Once the IDE has been downloaded you must download the repository. At the top of this page you will find a green button labled code "code". This is shown in the figure below.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MARTYC0DES/seniorProject/blob/main/images/11.png">
</p>
Download the zip file and unzip it. You may open Visual Studio Code. In the top left corner click the "File" tab, and then the "Open Workspace From File".
<p align="center">
